# Tippingwaiters overview
This is a machine learning project that predicts the amount of tips a waiter can expect to receive based on various factors such as the total bill, customer gender, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.
It helps for waitstaff and restaurants for the understanding and estimating tips.
